This project report aims to explore the potential of machine learning models in analyzing and
predicting the presence of heart disease. The dataset used in this study holds various medical
data about patients. This dataset will be further elaborated on, and explored in later sections.
The objective of this report is to analyze this dataset using various machine learning techniques
to determine the best model in order to hopefully successfully predict heart disease with great
accuracy.
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn and make
decisions based on patterns in data. It has been widely applied in various industries, including
finance, healthcare, and transportation. Machine learning models can help identify patterns,
detect anomalies, and predict outcomes in large datasets. In this report, we will use several
machine learning algorithms to analyze heart disease and evaluate their performance.
The report is structured as follows: First, we will provide a brief overview of the dataset and its
characteristics. Next, we will discuss the preprocessing steps taken to clean and prepare the
data for analysis. We will then introduce the different machine learning models used in this
project, including decision trees, random forests, KNN, logistic regression, and support vector
machines, and explain how they were trained and evaluated. Finally, we will present the results
of our analysis, evaluate the performance of each model, and conclude with our thoughts on
using the best model to make predictions of heart disease.
Overall, this report aims to showcase the power of machine learning in analyzing large datasets
and creating predictive models. We hope that our findings will provide valuable insights into
predicting heart disease and demonstrate the potential of machine learning in solving complex
problems
